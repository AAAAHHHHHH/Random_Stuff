So the project we have decided on this being is *drum roll please* a random object picker. I feel like this is going to be easier
said than done. Most notibly, when we get further on, I want it to be able to pick 2 from a set at random, and choose a winner
based on a set of rules. But first things first. Picking a random string from an array of strings.
