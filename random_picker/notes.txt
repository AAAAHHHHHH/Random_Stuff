So the project we have decided on this being is *drum roll please* a random object picker. I feel like this is going to be easier
said than done. Most notably, when we get further on, I want it to be able to pick 2 from a set at random, and choose a winner
based on a set of rules. But first things first. Picking a random string from an array of strings.

After months of putting it off after a major bug that I couldn't figure out, I have picked it back up. I technically fixed the bug yesterday, but today
I'm working on a new feature that should pick a random word from a list created by friends from a random range of 0 - 15 at max. Just need to get it working,
but I got a math test in 35 minutes and my hair is a mess. Good luck to me!
