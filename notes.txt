Finally got the bug where the text wasn't appearing on the website.
Time for phase 2: Guessing the number.
I have a guide of sorts to go off of, but it still promises to be a bit of a challenge doing it from scratch.
Ok, Version 1.0 is out after 8 failed tests!
Next on the agenda, counting the number of wins you have total!
While it will reset every time you reload the page, I plan to have a reset button already added to reset the score.
After that, averages of how many guesses it takes for you to win.
For instance, you won 3 times. In those 3 times, it took you the following number of guesses:
4
5
3
It would find the average of that, 4, and say it beside the number of wins you have.
