Based on the wild idea from a friend for an rpg type game entierly based on luck, I have started this. First the basic wants:
1. Luck based ablities (Combos, heals, steal, ect.)
2. Luck based basic fighting (Falling on your sword, crits, ect.)
3. Text based at first, once I get the basics set up may ask mom for help on the actual game aspect.
