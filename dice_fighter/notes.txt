Based on the wild idea from a friend for an rpg type game entirely based on luck, I have started this. First the basic wants:
1. Luck based abilities (Combos, heals, steal, ect.)
2. Luck based basic fighting (Falling on your sword, crits, ect.)
3. Text based at first, once I get the basics set up may ask mom for help on the actual game aspect.

We have had several bugs and other various problems throughout this, but we do now have the following features:
1. There are enemies
2. You can hit them
3. They can (sort of) hit you
The only problem with them hitting you is its returning something... that isn't a number.
I'll try to fix it best I can
